## Manufacturing Process

### Nozzle
1. Raw MS billet turned on **lathe machine**
2. Convergent section turned at **45° taper**
3. Throat bored to **6 mm** diameter
4. Divergent exit cone turned at **15° taper**
5. Outer flange fabricated **separately** (to protect nozzle from chuck jaws)
6. Flange TIG-welded to nozzle body
7. Bolt holes drilled on milling machine

> **Duration:** 3–4 days on lathe

### Casing
1. GI pipe (ID 85 mm) sourced as stock
2. Flange ring fabricated from MS flat
3. TIG welding of flange to pipe end
4. Other end capped with MS circular sheet (also TIG welded)
5. Bolt holes drilled at 45° pattern alignment

### Assembly
- Nozzle bolted to casing using **8× M6 stainless bolts**
- Gasket/seal applied at flange mating faces
- Total assembly weight: ~14.85 kg (MS material)
