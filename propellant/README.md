# Propellant — KNSU (Potassium Nitrate / Sucrose)

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `potassium_nitrate.png` | KNO₃ oxidizer — granular form |
| `sucrose_granular.png` | Sucrose (table sugar) fuel |
| `liquified_knsu_mix.png` | Melted KNSU mixture during casting |

## Formulation

| Component | Role | Proportion |
|-----------|------|------------|
| KNO₃ (Potassium Nitrate) | Oxidizer + Binder | 65% |
| C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ (Sucrose) | Fuel | 35% |
| SLS Surfactant | Processing aid | 0.1% |

**No separate binder needed** — KNO₃ acts as both oxidizer and structural binder.

## Combustion Reaction

```
2 KNO₃ + C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ → K₂CO₃ + CO₂ + H₂O + N₂ + energy
```

## Preparation Steps

1. Measure KNO₃ (65 g per 100 g batch) and sucrose (35 g)
2. Grind each component individually in a mill
3. Mix components until visually homogeneous (15 min manual shaking)
4. Heat on electric induction at **~121°C (250°F)**
5. Stir continuously with silicone spatula until molasses consistency (~5 min)
6. Add **0.1% SLS surfactant** — improves pour time
7. Pour into PVC casting tube through griddle hole
8. Insert **Teflon coring rod** to create tubular bore
9. Cure at room temperature for **2–4 hours**
10. Remove coring rod — grain is ready

## Key Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Specific impulse (Isp) | ~130 s (vacuum) |
| Burn rate | ~3–4 mm/s at 1 atm |
| Density | ~1.88 g/cm³ |
| Combustion products | Mostly non-toxic (K₂CO₃, CO₂, H₂O, N₂) |

## Safety

> ⚠️ **KNSU is a flammable oxidizing mixture. Follow all safety protocols:**
> - Work outdoors or in well-ventilated area
> - Never heat above 250°C (caramelization degrades performance)
> - Keep away from ignition sources during preparation
> - Store in cool, dry, airtight containers
> - Use proper PPE: gloves, eye protection
> - Never mix with chlorine-containing compounds

## Test Findings

- **Emplura grade KNO₃** produced less smoke vs Emparta grade → preferred
- Thick mixture form creates residue; **heating 20–30 min at 160–250°C** improves combustion
- Propellant hardens quickly on cooling — pour operation must be fast
- Caramelization of sucrose above 160°C reduces Isp — minimize heating time
